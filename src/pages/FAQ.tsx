        {
          question: "What is mediation?",
          answer: "Mediation is a voluntary, confidential process where a neutral third party (mediator) helps disputing parties reach a mutually acceptable resolution. Under the Mediation Act 2023, it's recognized as an alternative to litigation."
        },
        {
          question: "How is mediation different from court proceedings?",
          answer: "Mediation is typically faster, less expensive, private, and allows parties to control the outcome. Court proceedings are formal, public, and the judge makes the final decision."
        },
        {
          question: "Is mediation legally binding?",
          answer: "Yes, once parties reach an agreement through mediation and sign a settlement agreement, it becomes legally binding and enforceable under the Mediation Act 2023."
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      title: "Process & Procedure",
      faqs: [
        {
          question: "How long does mediation take?",
          answer: "Most mediations are completed within 2-6 sessions, with each session lasting 2-4 hours. The entire process typically takes 2-8 weeks, depending on the complexity of the dispute."
        },
        {
          question: "Can I have a lawyer present during mediation?",
          answer: "Yes, you can have legal representation during mediation sessions. However, the focus is on collaborative problem-solving rather than adversarial advocacy."
        },
        {
          question: "What happens if mediation fails?",
          answer: "If mediation doesn't result in an agreement, you retain all your legal rights and can pursue other dispute resolution methods, including litigation or arbitration."
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      title: "Costs & Fees",
      faqs: [
        {
          question: "How much does mediation cost?",
          answer: "Mediation costs vary based on the type of dispute, mediator experience, and duration. Generally, it ranges from â‚¹5,000-75,000 total, which is typically much less than litigation costs."
        },
        {
          question: "Who pays for mediation?",
          answer: "Usually, mediation costs are shared equally between parties, though they can agree to a different arrangement. Some cases may qualify for subsidized or free mediation services."
        },
        {
          question: "Are there any hidden fees?",
          answer: "No, all mediation fees should be disclosed upfront. This includes the mediator's fee, administrative costs, and any venue charges if applicable."
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      title: "Platform & Technology",
      faqs: [
        {
          question: "How do online mediation sessions work?",
          answer: "Online sessions are conducted through secure video conferencing platforms. All parties join a virtual mediation room where the mediator facilitates the discussion just like in-person sessions."
        },
        {
          question: "Is online mediation as effective as in-person mediation?",
          answer: "Yes, studies show online mediation can be equally effective. It offers convenience, reduces travel costs, and can sometimes help parties feel more comfortable in their own environment."
        },
        {
          question: "What technology do I need for online mediation?",
          answer: "You need a computer, tablet, or smartphone with internet access, camera, and microphone. Our platform works on most modern browsers without requiring special software."
